# python-chatting
I'm trying to make a chatting application based on flask. What it needs(for now): flask, flask-socketio, jQuery, python 

# GOAL
* Verify users' login(For now, I haven't decided what the way is.)
* Transfrom message using a peer-to-peer network.
* Encrypt the message that the users send and receive.
* A simple availble chatting robot that you can talk to.

  ~~Sadly, I just have done so few things~~
